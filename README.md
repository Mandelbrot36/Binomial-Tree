# Binomial-Tree
Binomial tree - 
A project done together with my colleagues. 
My part of the work was the implementation of the binomial model itself as part of the analysis and proof of the unity of the prices of American and European call options. 

We took as our goal the implementation of the model, the pricing of options (American and European call and put) for specific parameters. 

Then we moved on to the analysis:
- the moments of exercise of the American option
- the volatility of option pricing for a change in parameters
- reduction of the delta t step
- dependencies between options.
